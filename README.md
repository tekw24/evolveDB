# EvolveDB
EvolveDB is an approach to model-driven schema evolution in relational databases, where the user specifies the evolution steps by freely editing a database model extracted by reverse engineering. EvolveDB analyzes the differences between the status quo and the evolved model structures and generates a data migration script. EvolveDB is currently available as an Eclipse Feature.
A screencast of the demo is available at https://youtu.be/ieXmrDd2nw4. 

We also provide an end-user tutorial ([Benutzerhandbuch_Endanwender.pdf](https://github.com/tekw24/evolveDB/files/9417273/Benutzerhandbuch_Endanwender.pdf))  with detailed examples in our repo. If anything should be unclear or if you have questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.



The development of EvolveDB were supported by [StudiumPlus](https://www.studiumplus.de/sp/). StudiumPlus is part of the Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen (THM) and offers dual study programs.
