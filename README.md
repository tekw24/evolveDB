# EvolveDB
EvolveDB is an approach to model-driven schema evolution in relational databases, where the user specifies the evolution steps by freely editing a database model extracted by reverse engineering. EvolveDB analyzes the differences between the status quo and the evolved model structures and generates a data migration script. EvolveDB is currently available as an Eclipse Feature.
A screencast of the demo is available at https://youtu.be/ieXmrDd2nw4.
