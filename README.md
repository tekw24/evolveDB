# EvolveDB
EvolveDB is an approach to model-driven schema evolution in relational databases, where the user specifies the evolution steps by freely editing a database model extracted by reverse engineering. EvolveDB analyzes the differences between the status quo and the evolved model structures and generates a data migration script. EvolveDB is currently available as an Eclipse Feature.
A screencast of the demo is available at https://youtu.be/ieXmrDd2nw4. 

We also provide an end-user tutorial ([End_User_Tutorial.pdf](https://github.com/tekw24/evolveDB/files/9819474/End_User_Tutorial.pdf))  with detailed examples in our repo.

We did an initial evaluation. We provide some details in the following document. [EvolveDB_Evaluation.pdf](https://github.com/tekw24/evolveDB/files/9854589/EvolveDB_Evaluation.pdf)
